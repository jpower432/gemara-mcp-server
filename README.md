A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for [Gemara](https://github.com/ossf/gemara) - the GRC Engineering Model for Automated Risk Assessment. This server provides tools and prompts for creating, validating, and managing Gemara artifacts (Layer 1 Guidance, Layer 2 Controls, and Layer 3 Policies).

## Overview

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build the binary
go build ./cmd/gemara-mcp-server

# Run with stdio transport (default)
./gemara-mcp-server
```

For detailed development instructions, containerization, and configuration, see [CURSOR.md](CURSOR.md).
